# Evaluation-Metrics
Show how to deal with accuracy and calcualte percentage of error in Regression and Classification.

In code include:
1) Calculate error in regression and classification.
2) know how to calculate accuracy of model.
3) In Classification use recall_score, precision_score, confusion_matrix and f1_score.
4) In Regression use mean absolute error, mean squrare error and r2_score
5) This calculate know you have the best model or not.
